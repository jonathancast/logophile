# Profitable Software General Public License

This is the Profitable Software License, Version 0.3.
This is a general license - because it can be applied by contributors to any software they own some exclusive rights in -
and a public license - because, once applied it automatically grants rights to everyone in the world.

## Grant of rights

Specifically, once applied by one or more licensors to a piece of software,
it grants you (regardless of who you are) the right to

 * use the sofware,
 * make copies of it,
 * bypass any technological measures which control access to it,
 * modify it,
 * incorporate parts of it into other software,
 * incorporate it by reference into other software,
 * distribute it, or programs into which you incorporate it, with or without modifications, in source or binary form, and
 * use its name, or parts of it, to advertise modified or un-modified copies of it you distribute,

provided you comply with the terms of this license,
even if doing so would otherwise violate the patent, copyright, trade secret, trade mark, or contractual right of the licensors under the laws of your country.

Furthermore, if the software constitutes a technological measure which controls access to any other content,
you may bypass that measure to do anything you otherwise have the legal right to do,
even if doing so would otherwise violate the rights of the licensors under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws.

## Not a denial of existing rights

If you have the full legal right to do something, under the laws of your country,
you retain the right to do it, whether or not you comply with this license.

In order for you to be required to comply with this license,
there must be two things you are doing, thing A and thing B,
where thing A requires permission under this license
and this license states something you must do if you do thing B,
and thing A and thing B are the same thing or are inseparable parts of the same activity.

Licensors explicitly recognize your rights under the "fair use" doctrine of US law,
and similar rights that may exist in other countries;
nothing in this license is intended to deny you of those rights,
as long as your actions remain within the limits of them.

You may use the APIs, structure, and layout of this program in your own programs,
regardless of whether you otherwise need a license to do so,
without complying with any requirements of this license.

You may study this program, and use its algorithms and data structures in your own program,
regardless of whether you otherwise need a license to do so,
without complying with any requirement of this license,
even if doing so produces incidental similarities between your program and the original,
as long as you don't actually copy the verbatim code from that program into yours.

## Overview of Requirements

You are required to do five main things under this license, subject to the conditions below:

1. Apply this license to software,
2. Distribute software in source form,
3. Allow those on whose behalf you operate software to replace you,
4. Not interfere with local modifications to software, and
5. Pay royalites on software.

You are required to do them for four categories of software:

1. This program,
2. Modified versions you make of this program,
3. Other programs into which you copy portions of this program, and
4. Other programs into which you incorporate this program by reference.

"This program" refers to the program you receive rights to under this license.

All of those programs will be referred to as "covered programs"
when there is no need to distinguish between the different categories.

## Notice and offers to distribute

Whenever you distribute covered software or operate it on behalf of someone else,
you must provide them with a notice that the software is under this license,
and a list of everything this license requires you to also distribute to them
which you do not distribute alongside the software,
along with the process to request such items.

In no case are you complying with this license if you charge extra
for anything you are required to distribute,
or if your process for requesting such an item is excessively onerous,
or if you forbid or prevent recipients from designating a third party to receive it in their place.

## Licensing Software

If you are aware that this program contains things copyrighted by you,
or embodies any patent controlled by you,
or contains any of your trade secrets or trade secrets,
or that you have any contractual rights that would prevent anyone else from exercising their rights under this license,
you must apply this license to those rights in this program
(or you receive no rights to this program from anyone else under this license).

If you make a modified version of this program,
or copy part of this program into another program,
or write or modify a program that incorporates this program by reference,
you apply this license to the resulting program.
If you cannot legally do so, you may not perform those activities to produce such a program, either.

## Distributing Source Forms

You may distribute covered programs in source form,
including gratis or for a fee,
in any form, including over a computer network, on a physical medium, or embodied in a physical device.

If you distribute a covered program in a non-source form,
you must make the corresponding source form available in a similar way to anyone who receives the non-source form
and at no additional cost.

You may distribute the corrresponding source form alongside the non-source form,
at the same time and in the same way.
If you do not do so, you must provide the source form to anyone who has received the non-source form,
who requests it within three years of receiving the source form.
(And you must supply *corresponding* source, not simply the latest source!)

If you distribute the non-source form over an electronic network,
you must supply the source form over the same network,
at no additional cost,
although you may limit access to it to only those who have previously downloaded the non-source form.

If you distribute the non-source form on a physical medium,
you must supply the source form on a physical medium,
readable by computers commonly used to program the device the non-source form is for,
(when appropriate, the same physical medium as the non-source form).

If you distribute the non-source form embedded in a physical device,
you must supply the source form on a physical medium,
readable by computers commonly used to program that device,
(when appropriate, by the device itself),
or embedded in the same device,
when the device is one that is commonly used to develop software for itself.

### Definitions

The "source form" of software is the preferred form for modifying it.

The "source form" of software specifically includes everything
which would be used or modified by a programmer
in the normal course of studying or modifying the software.
Some things which are part of the source form of software which are not commonly regarded as part of the "source code" include

 * Version-control metadata,
 * Automated tests used during development,
 * The source form of developer and architecture documentation, and
 * The source form of end-user documentation.

The "corresponding" source form to a non-source form of the software
is one that can be used to reproduce the given non-source form.
It includes the source form of any end-user documentation
which you distribute alongside the non-source form of the software,
and of any end-user documentation which you make available
to the recipients over an electronic network.

A source form of software includes any software necessary to modify itself.

### Licensing source forms

Everything you are required to distribute as part of the source form of covered software
must be licensed under this license,
or another appropriate license
that allows the source form to be modified and redistributed alongside the covered software itself.

If you do not have permission to so license anything in the source form of the software,
you may not perform any activity which would create an obligation to distribute it.

## Operating software on behalf of someone else

If you operate covered software on behalf of someone else,
they have the right to operate it themselves instead,
or to hire someone else to operate it for them.
You may not use your exclusive possession of a modified version of the software
to prevent them from doing so.

### Distribute source form

If you operate covered software on behalf of others,
you must provide corresponding source code for the current version you operate
to anyone on whose behalf you operate it.

If a person on whose behalf you operate the software interacts with it over an electronic network,
you must make source code available to them, or any third party designated by them,
over the same electronic network;
otherwise, you must make it available to them either over an electronic network,
or by sending it to them on an appropriate physical medium,
whichever is more appropriate to your normal method of communication with them.

### Distribute installable form

In addition, to make it easier for them to change to another operator,
you must provide them the software in the most readily-installable form,
in the same way you would provide the source form to them.

### Definitions

The most readily-installable form is the form that would be most convenient for you
to install on a new computer, in order to operate it on behalf of others.

### Administration Scripts

When distributing the software to someone on whose behalf you are operating it,
in source form or in readily-installable form,
you must include any system administration scripts you use to automate the operation of the software.

### Data

If, as part of operating the software on behalf of someone else,
you store and process any data for them,
you must also make that data available to them,
or any other person designated by them,
for no additional cost,
in the same way you would provide the source form to them.

### Licensing source forms

Everything you are required to distribute as part of the source form of covered software
must be licensed under this license,
or another appropriate license
that allows the source form to be modified and redistributed alongside the covered software itself.

If you do not have permission to so license anything in the source form of the software,
you may not perform any activity which would create an obligation to distribute it.

## Local modifications of software

If you distribute covered software embodied in a physical device,
and it is possible for you to update the software on that device,
you must supply the recipient with any technical information or documentation
they need to update it themselves with their own modified versions.

If you distribute covered software in a form or on a platform
that requires it to be cryptographically signed in order to be used,
you must supply the user with what they need
to use their own modified version of the software instead.
Note that this does not mean you must supply them your own encyrption keys;
you could, instead, generate a key pair for each device you distribute,
install both your public key and the per-device key on each device,
and distribute the per-device private key,
that only works for that device,
alongside the device;
or, you could allow the user to install their own public keys on the device,
and provide them with technical documentation on how to do so.

If covered software connects to a network server operated by you,
you must not attempt to detect if the covered software has been modified,
and provide different or inferior behavior to modified clients.

If covered software is normally downloaded from you every time it is run,
you must not do anything to prevent the user from directing their computer to use a different source for the software.

## Paying royalties on software

If you advertise publically your willingness to distribute copies of covered software to users,
you must pay the contributors to the software the amount of money specified in the copy you distribute
for each unique person to whom you distribute the software.

Similarly, if you advertise publically your willingness to operate covered software on behalf of others,
you must pay the contributors to the software the amount of money specified in the copy you operate
for each unique person for whom you operate the software.

If you operate the software on behalf of someone else,
and provide them with a copy of the software in accordance with this license,
you need not pay royalties for distributing that copy.

If you are supplied a copy of the software by another person, in order to operate it for them,
or they direct the person operating the software for them to give it to you to operate for them,
or you know someone else was already operating the software for them,
you need not pay royalties for that person.

### Paying royalties

If there are multiple contributors to the software
you must divide up the royalties among the contributors proportionally to the number of lines of code they contributed
according to the version control information in the copy you are distributing or operating.

You may select any amount of money in the currency you use which has an exchange rate value of 10 pounds sterling or less,
and round the royalties you owe in any given month down to a multiple of that amount,
and also divide the royalties you owe for that month among all contributors in multiples of that amount,
even if it means some contributors receive no royalties for that month.

### Technical writers and automated testers

The contributors who receive royalties include all contributors
to the version control repository in which the software is maintained,
and all contributors to any other version control repositories
in which documentation or automated tests
which are part of the source form of the software
are maintained.

### If you cannot pay a contributor

If for whatever reason,
after contacting a contributor in the contributors list,
and attempting to arrange payment,
you cannot make a royalty payment to that contributor,
you must distribute royalties to the other contributors,
who you can pay,
in the same proportional way as above.

If you cannot pay any contributor royalties, for whatever reason, you need not pay royalties,
but may continue distributing or operating the software.

However, if you cannot pay the contributors for legal reasons,
due to the countries in which you and they live,
and those in other countries would be able to pay them,
you may only distribute the software to others, or operate it on behalf of others, who live in the same country as you,
or who would otherwise themselves also be legally unable to pay royalties to the contributors.

### Diversions

A copy of covered software may designate a person other than the contributors to receive the initial payment of royalties.
In this case, you must pay the whole designated amount (rounded down if you choose) to that person,
and also give them a list of the number of lines in the copy you distributed contributed by each person.

In this case, the person who receives the initial payment
may take a portion to spend on their own operating expenses,
and spend an additional portion on activities which benefit the development of the software as a whole,
such as advertising or marketing the software,
legal expenses on behalf of the software,
organizing or coordinating development of the software,
or testing the software,
and the rest must be divided among contributors as above.

However, contributors must not be paid for their contributions,
except by distribution of royalties as specified in this license,
and contributors may not be paid more than fair market value for other activities.

### Updates

If you distribute an updated copy of covered software to someone who already has an older copy,
or you begin operating a newer version of the software for someone on whose behalf you were operating an older copy:

  1. If they receive the update within 2 years of getting their previous copy, the royalties owed are pro-rated according to the number of months / 24 since the previous copy.
  2. You must divide the royalties between the contributors who wrote the lines of the software
     which were modified between the older copy and the newer one,
     proportional to the number of modified lines they contributed.
  3. If you continuously distribute updated copies of the software to someone over the course of a month,
     you may pay one consolidated royalty payment to the contributors of all the modified lines at the end of the month.

If you distribute a complete copy of the software to someone whom you are unaware has an older version,
you may disregard this section.

### Warranties

You do not need to pay royalties on updates to the software if
all the updates are changes which the contributors are obligated to make to the software under warranty.

### Adding a diversion

You may add, modify, or remove such a diversion of the initial payment of royalties,
to any covered software,
with the consent of a majority of the contributors to that version of the software,
measured by lines contributed according to the version control system in use.

### Forks

If a diversion is present in covered software,
and you produce a modified version of that software,
and the person who receives the initial payment of royalties
only spends money for the development of the original version of the software,
and does not equally benefit your modified version,
you may replace the diversion with one to another person,
who will spend similar amounts of money on similar activities
to the person designated by the majority of contributors.

In this section, "you" refers to an individual or a group
who produces and maintains a modified version of the software,
separately from the majority of contributors.

### Bans on distributing or operating the software

The amount of royalties required for distributing or operating the software
is a "ban" on doing so
if it is so high that it is impossible to distribute or operate the software
in such a way as to make that amount of money from doing so
plus a reasonable markup to reflect the cost of distributing or operating the software.

(Making money from distributing or operating covered software
will generally mean charging money for doing so,
selling ads which are displayed alongside the download page for the software
or on its packaging,
or embedding ads into the software to be displayed to the user,
but can include other innovative ways of making money that are generally accessible
to people who want to use them.)

For the purposes of this license,
when placing a royalty amount on covered software,
an amount is a ban unless you have a good-faith belief it is not,
and when distributing or operating software,
an amount is a ban if you have a good-faith belief that it is.

You may not place an amount of required royalties on covered software
unless you believe in good faith it is not a ban on distributing or operating the software.

If you believe in good faith that the amount of required royalties on covered software is a ban on distributing or operating it,
you may contact the contributors and inform them of that fact.

 * If the contributors provide you with good evidence that it is not a ban,
   then you no longer have a good faith belief that it is,
   and must pay the royalties required by this license.
 * If the contributors agree with you that it is a ban,
   and agree to allow you to reduce the amount of royalties to a lower amount,
   you may do so in your copy, and pay the lower royalties for that copy.
 * If the contributors fail to either show you the amount is not a ban or give you permission to reduce the amount
   to one that is not a ban
   within one month of you contacting them,
   you need not pay royalties as long as you continue to believe the amount is a ban.

You may follow the same procedure if you believe the amount required is a ban
on distributing or operating the software to an identifiable group based on objective characteristics,
especially including level of income;
if you do not receive permission within one month to pay a lower royalty amount for members of that group,
you need not pay any royalties for members of that group.

If some people were willing to pay a high price for a copy of the software,
or for someone else to operate the software for them,
but now have a copy of the software, either themselves or that someone else is running for them,
and now the amount of money demanded is a ban on distributing the software to anyone who does not have a copy,
or operating the software for anyone who does not already have someone operating it for them,
it is (now) a ban (although it wasn't previously).

### Changing royalty amounts

Subject to the above condition,
you may place any royalty amount you like on programs into which you incorporate portions of this program
or programs that incorporate this program by reference.

Subject to the above condition,
you may increase the royalty amount required on modified copies of this program,
and you may decrease the royalty amount required on modified copies of this program
with the consent of a majority of the contributors to the modified version.

### Unfair distribution and operation

"Unfair" distribution of operation (on behalf of others) of covered software
is when someone who is entitled to receive royalties
distributes the software or operates it on behalf of others
in a way that would not enable a general member of the public
to make enough money from it to pay the required royalties,
with a reasonable markup left over to cover the costs of distribution or operation.

The assumption in this case is that they are using their entitlement to a portion of the royalties
to undercut other licensees in the market.

You may not engage in unfair distribution or operation of covered software,
regardless of why you do so.

## Incorporating covered software into other programs by reference

One program is considered to incorporate another program by reference
if it refers to that program,
or parts of that program,
specifically,
in a way that causes the computer, when running the first program,
to reach and access the other program and use its functionality.

Whether a program incorporates another program by reference or not
depends only on the relationship of the two programs as creative works
and specifically does not depend on the technical details of how the program is incorporated,
whether by static or dynamic linking,
or by being executed as a separate process,
or used as a system daemon or network service,
or as an operating system kernel,
or the code being referenced is part of an interpreter or compiler
used to process or execute the incorporating program.

In some cases, a reference to another program
may be to any of a class of programs
which expose a similar API and behavior.
In this case, the class may or may not have a "lead program"
which originates the behavior and defines the standard for the other class members.
A program which refers to such a class
incorporates this program by reference
if and only if this program is the lead program in that class.

However, if this program belongs to such a class,
even it if is not the lead program,
another program that specifically requires this program
and only this program from that class
still incorporates this program by reference.

## Aggregating covered software with other works

You may distribute covered software alongside other works that are not covered software,
provided you otherwise comply with this license,
and provided it is possible for the recipients to extract the covered software and redistribute it separately,
and provided it is possible for the recipients to replace the covered software with a modified version after installing it on a device.

If your method of combination would not normally allow those things to happen,
you may comply with this license by distributing to the recipient, on request,
the covered software and those other works in the last form they took
before being inextricably combined,
so that the covered software may be independently redistributed
and modified versions of it may be combined with the other works to make a useable whole.

You must also provide the recipient with permission to make such a combination
of the other works with modified versions of the software,
and you must distribute to them any programs necessary to do so.

## No Special Privileges

This license has five major conditions:

 1. You must apply this license to software.
 2. You must distribute source forms of software.
 3. You must distribute readily-installable forms of software, and user data.
 4. You must not interfere with modified versions of software.
 5. You must pay royalties and not engage in unfair distribution or operation.

There are four categories of software they apply to:

 1. This program.
 2. Modified versions of this program.
 3. Other programs into which portions of this program are incorporated.
 4. Other programs which incorporate this program by reference.

A licensor "voids" a requirement if one of four things happens:

 1. There is only one licensor,
    and that licensor does something that would violate that requirement if a licensee did it.
 2. There is only one licensor,
    and that licensor grants someone else permission to violate that requirement.
 3. There are multiple licensors,
    and any one licensor receives permission from all other licensors to violate that requirement.
 4. There are multiple licensors,
    and any one licensor receives permission from all other licensors to grant exceptions to that requirement.

If a licensor voids any of the five above requirements for any of the four above categories of covered software,
you need not comply with that requirement for that or any subsequent category of covered software.

A licensor who voids a requirement by not following it
can cure the voiding - reinstating the requirement -
the same way that a licensee who violates that requirement can cure the breach.

A licensor who voids a requirement by granting someone else an exception to it
can cure the voiding only by revoking the exceptions, if possible,
or releasing a new version of the software to which the exceptions do not apply.

A licensor who voids a requirement by receiving permission from the other licensors
can cure the voiding by agreeing with all other licensors to revoke the permissions.

In any case, once a voiding is cured, the requirement is reinstated.

## Other licenses

The software may indicate include a list of licenses which apply to it.

Any licensor who permits use of the software under this license also permits its use under any so-listed license.

Such indication may also apply to any category of covered software, and to all subsequent categories;
so a license may be allowed for all four categories,
or only for modified versions and other programs that incorporate this one,
or only for programs that incorporate this one,
or only for programs that incorporate this one by refence.

### Modifying the license list.

You may remove licenses from the list of allowed licenses,
or move licenses down the list of categories of covered software,
as long as you preserve any one license that applies to your modified copy of this program.

You may add licenses to the license list with the consent of a majority of the contributors.

## Voting Procedure

Normally, when required to get the consent of a majority of contributors for something,
you must contact them, individually or in a public place such as a mailing list,
and wait for their responses.

Covered software may contain a more detailed notice and voting procedure,
or designate another authority who can act on behalf of the contributors,
in which case you must follow such designation instead.

If you create a program into which you copy portions of this program,
or which incorporates this program by reference,
you may place any such voting procedure or authority designation on it.

You may add, modify, or remove such voting procedure or authority designation
in modified copies of this program with the consent of a majority of contributors;
you may always remove an authority designation or voting procedure
with the consent of a majority of the actual contributors,
regardless of what procedure or designation is currently in place.

## Maintaining authorship information of software

1. If you modify the software and give someone else a copy of that modified version,
   you must update the version control metadata in the source form to indicate your authorship of any changed lines.
2. If you modify the software and give someone else a copy of that modified version,
   you must update the list of contributors in the software to include your name,
   and to indicate where your royalties should be paid to
   (even if your modifications are not enough that you would normally receive royalties for them).
   You must also update all copyright statements on the software to include your name,
   or to say "Copyright © Contributors" or similar.
3. You may not update the version control metadata in the source form
   to indicate your authorship of any lines that were previously attributed to anyone else,
   without their consent,
   unless the changes you made were integral to a change to the functionality of the software,
   and were either necessary to make the change or necessary to maintain the previous indentation style of the software.
4. You may not remove anyone's name from the contributors list, unless you have also removed all portions of the software they contributed.
5. You may not change the indication of where royalties owed to a contributor should be sent without their consent.

## Things you need not distribute

You are not required under this license to distribute any program, tool, or script
which is generally available to people who perform its purpose.

However, if the version of such program, tool, or script you use
was created by you or for you, or provided privately to you,
or modified compared to the generally-available version,
you must distribute it.
If you cannot do so legally, you may not do anything under this license which would require you to distribute it.

You need only distribute electronic files which you possess, used to possess, or can readily obtain.

In particular, if you receive a non-source form of the software from someone else,
never obtain the corresponding source form from them,
and can no longer obtain it from them,
you may continue to redistribute the non-source form you have,
without providing the source form you do not have.

However, if a file you are required to distribute is one you created or modified,
and you no lose access to it,
you may no longer engage in any activity
as a result of which this license would require you to distribute it.

## Warranty of licensability

The licensors named in this program represent that,
to the best of their knowledge,
they have the legal right to apply this license to this program,
and indemnify licensees against any damages in the event this license is invalid.

## Suits and Termination

If any lawsuit between you and any licensor or licensors under this license proceeds to final legal judgment,
the loser will pay all legal costs for both parties,
to the extent permitted by applicable law.

You cannot lose your rights under this license for failure to pay royalties,
although you can be sued for doing so and be subject to legal judgments.

If you violate any term of this license except by non-payment of royalties,
you lose all rights under this license until such time as you heal the breach.

Healing a breach of this license means complying with all terms you violated,
including giving notice to all persons to whom you failed to give proper notices,
and distributing all files you are required to distribute to all people who have requested but not received them.

If you are not legally able to heal a breach of this license,
your rights under this license terminate and cannot be restored
except with the express consent of every licensor.

If any licensor or licensors sues you for violating any other term of this license,
you can at any time before final legal judgment, if allowed by applicable law,
settle the lawsuit, at your option, by healing the breach as above.
If you do so, the licensor or licensors who sued you will pay all your legal costs,
to the extent permitted under applicable law.

Other than as provided in this section,
your rights under this license are perpetual
and may not be revoked by any licensor at any time for any reason.

## Warranty

The software is warrantied by the contributors to be free of programming defects
that would cause the software to not function as intended by the contributors,
on computer systems similar to those on which it is intended to be used, or
would cause the software to be insecure when used as intended.
If you are dissatisfied with the functionality of the software,
you may inform all contributors to whom you have paid royalties,
destroy all your copies of the software,
and receive a refund of all royalties paid within 2 years prior to your notice.

Should you discover any programming defect
which would cause the software not to function as intended by the contributors, or
which causes a security problem when the software is used as intended,
you may notify the contributor whose programming was defective,
and you will receive from the contributor, at no charge,
whatever changes to the software are necessary to repair the defect.

This warranty is good for a period of 10 years only
after any portion of the software was first distributed by a contributor to another person.

This section constitutes, to the extent allowed by applicable law, the entire warranty on the software;
if any portion of this section is held to be unenforceable,
the software shall have no warranty to the extent allowed under law.

## Non-severability and legal limitations

If any portion of this license is held to be unenforceable, the whole license shall be invalid,
and no one shall receive any rights under this software.

## Applying to your program

To apply this license to your program,
store the source code of you program under a suitable version control system;
include a copy of this license in it, in a separate file;
include a list of contributors, in a separate file, with your name as stored in the version control system;
and instructions on how to pay royalties to you
(e.g., you can give a Paypal URL such as paypal.me/foo, a Bitcoin public key, or a physical address);
and include a prominent notice somewhere in your program (such as in a COPYRIGHT file):

    Copyright © <your name> <the year(s) you distribute copies of the software in>
    This software is free as in freedom, not in price;
    you may modify or redistribute it, if you pay a small royalty amount, under the terms of the Profitable Software License,
    included in the file PSL.

(Change the file name if necessary).
Either list the royalty amount you want there or in a separate 'royalties' file.

If you wrote the program as part of your job,
talk to your employer,
get permission to use this license,
and ask about the proper copyright notice to use,
and where royalties for your contributions should be sent.

If you wrote the program as part of your job,
and you continue modifying it after you leave,
be sure you use different email addresses for modifications you make before and after you leave,
so you can direct the royalties to different places if you need to.

If you are employed as a programmer,
but you wrote the program outside of work,
you may want to get a written statement from your employer
that the program is not work for hire for them
and you own the copyright on it.
