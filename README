This is Logophile.

One day, this is going to be a text editor for Unix.

Right now, there's nothing to see here.
Go check out

 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_95
to see our inspirations.

(We aware that is an . . . eclectic . . . set of inspirations).

Logophile is free software; you are free to use and modify it under certain conditions.
See the file GPL3 for details.

One day, Logophile will come with a warranty - if you pay for it - but not right now.
See the file WARRANTY for details.

If you want to help out, considering sending $5 to https://paypal.me/jonathanccast,

Once there is code here, feel free to check it out and see if it works for you;
