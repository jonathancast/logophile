This is ALPHA software.
While the contributors are proud of their engineering,
and have made every possible effort to produce reliable, useful software,
it is not practical for them to make any guarantees of correctness
without further testing.

As such, like other GPL3-licensed software,
this program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Bug reports - especially reproduceable ones - will be gratefully received at jonathanccast AT fastmail.fm,
where they will be used to improve the quality of future releases of the software,

It is the intentions of the contributors to eventually make a proper release with a warranty.
HOWEVER: if you received this software free of charge, without paying anything to the contributors,
please be aware that it does come with a full money-back guarantee,
and if it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.

In releases for which the maintainers can provide a warranty,
this file will be updated with instructions on how to send money to the contributors,
entering into an actual contractual relationship with them,
and obtaining a guarantee of suitability for purpose, bug fixes / security patches,
and indemnity against losses caused by appropriate operation of the software.
