This is ALPHA software.
While the contributors are proud of their engineering,
and have made every possible effort to produce reliable, useful software,
it is not practical for them to make any guarantees of correctness
without further testing.

Bug reports - especially reproducible ones - will be gratefully received at jonathanccast AT fastmail.fm,
where they will be used to improve the quality of future releases of the software,

It is the intentions of the contributors to eventually make a proper release with a warranty.
Contributions toward that goal, in the form of bug fixes, good bug reports, or money, will be gratefully accepted.
